# Bot22
A bot for Geometry Dash 2.2

## Usage
You need to have Python installed on your computer. I tested it with 3.9, but it should work perfectly fine with anything above that. https://python.org

Download the bot from here: https://github.com/Milk-Cool/Bot22 (click Code -> Download ZIP) and unpack it. Now you can install the requirements using `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (run that in console in the folder with the unpacked files) and then you can run the file by either double-clicking it in explorer or using `python main.py`.

First you'll need to find the addresses of X position variables. You do that just like in Cheat Engine - rewrite the value of the x pos shown in the debug menu to the console, wait for it to scan, repeat until 8 - 9 addresses are left. It's important to not exit the level! Now you can record (press backslash to exit) the macro and then replay it (also use backslash when done).

Of course it isn't perfect, but it will be improved. Platformer support is also coming soon!
